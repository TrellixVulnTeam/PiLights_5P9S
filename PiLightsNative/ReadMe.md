# This is a Guide to install what is needed to start and install a Native project.

Install expo-cli. This should already be done globally but to do it again
`sudo npm i -g expo-cli`. I would recommend using the js managed. Maybe use typescript if you know it.

to run it we use it we first need to make sure are using the right node version. For me I run `nvm install 16` and then `nvm use 16` and then finally

`npm start` and then press i for the Ios Emulator.
